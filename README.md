PathDemo
========

This code is heavily based off Romain Guy's blog post @
http://www.curious-creature.org/2013/12/21/android-recipe-4-path-tracing/.  I wanted to understand
how this effect works and see if I could re-create it with minimal code possible.

The idea was to abstract it into a library that others could use in their apps similar to
[Muzei](https://plus.google.com/113735310430199015092/posts/Aehbga4yF8M).  I didn't make it that far
but there's no reason this code couldn't be enchanced for that in the future.
